# Coyote-Test
This is an front end app developed with `React` and `styled-components`.

This application follows a `users` journey from entering a word into the coyote input box to the user recieving a `response` triggered by a MockApi (Promise), which is used to display either the input text or a error message to the `user`.

### Validation
-   Successful Promise: A user enters less than 10 characters into the input field. 
-   Unsuccesful Promise: A user enters more than 10 characters in the input field. 

### Tech Stack 
-   UI: React
-   Styling: styled-components
